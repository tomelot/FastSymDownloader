# FastReload - A Faster Symbol Downloader for WinDbg

I got bored of waiting for WinDbg to finish downloading all the symbols from a dump file I was trying to debug, so I asked ChatGPT to write me an extension that downloads symbols **multithreaded**, because for some reason WinDbg downloads each symbol **synchronously**.

After some tinkering, I made the code work ‚Äî and the final result is pretty good. The performance improvement will of course depend on your internet speed and hardware, but WinDbg‚Äôs default algorithm is so slow that **almost everyone should see a significant speed-up**.

### üîß Recommendation
**Remove the symbol server URL from the WinDbg symbol path**.  
Why? Because WinDbg still tries to download symbols itself (even after mine), and it does so one-by-one with long timeouts.  
Instead, **only include your cache directory** in `.sympath`, and let `!FastReload` handle everything else.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
You can configure the extension using environment variables:

- `SYMBOL_SERVER`: the symbol server URL (default: `https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols`)
- `SYMBOL_CACHE`: the local symbol cache path (default: `C:\symbols`)

### üöÄ Usage

Inside WinDbg, just run:

```
!FastReload
```

And let it handle the rest.
